# Vaccine Misinformation on Reddit: A Policy Brief

## Project Overview
In this project, I explored the **spread of vaccine misinformation** on **Reddit**, focusing specifically on the link between **vaccines and autism**. Using **sentiment analysis**, **topic modeling**, and **policy analysis**, I investigated how misinformation spreads in Reddit discussions and provided **recommendations** to mitigate its impact.

Reddit, as a **digital public sphere**, allows users to engage in public discourse, but it also poses challenges in addressing **health-related misinformation**. This project examines these dynamics and offers solutions to enhance the platform's responsibility in combating misinformation.

## Key Objectives
- **Analyze Reddit discussions** around vaccines and autism to detect patterns of misinformation.
- Conduct **sentiment analysis** and **topic modeling** to evaluate user engagement and common themes.
- Provide **policy recommendations** for Reddit to address the spread of misinformation more effectively.
  
## Data Sources
- **Reddit comments** discussing vaccines and autism were scraped from relevant subreddits.
  
## Methods
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Used models to analyze user sentiment towards vaccines in Reddit posts.
- **LDA Topic Modeling**: Identified recurring themes and topics in user discussions.
- **Policy Analysis**: Developed policy suggestions for Reddit based on the analysis of data and platform behavior.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for scripting and analysis.
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn** for sentiment analysis.
- **NLTK**, **spaCy** for natural language processing.
- **Gensim** for LDA topic modeling.
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for data visualization.

## Key Findings
- Reddit facilitates **engaged debate** on vaccines, but its **content policy** is not strict enough to prevent misinformation from spreading.
- **Echo chambers** in subreddits amplify misinformation, making it harder to debunk false claims.
- **Sentiment analysis** revealed mixed user opinions, with certain subreddits showing a **strong anti-vaccine stance**.
- **Topic modeling** highlighted discussions on **vaccine side effects**, **autism**, and **distrust of medical authorities**.

## Recommendations
To improve its role in combating health-related misinformation, Reddit could:
- Enhance **user reporting mechanisms** for identifying misinformation.
- Implement **stricter content moderation policies** targeting health-related posts.
- Collaborate with organizations like the **WHO** and **fact-checking services** to verify health claims.
- Promote **media literacy** among users to help them critically evaluate information.
  
## Conclusion
Addressing **misinformation on Reddit** is critical to protecting public health. The platform must take an active role in moderating discussions, especially on health-related topics, to ensure that users have access to **factual information**. These measures will contribute to a more **informed and responsible digital public sphere**.

## Future Enhancements
- Extend the analysis to other platforms, such as **Facebook** or **Twitter**.
- Incorporate **real-time monitoring** of vaccine-related discussions.
- Train a **custom sentiment model** specific to health-related misinformation.
