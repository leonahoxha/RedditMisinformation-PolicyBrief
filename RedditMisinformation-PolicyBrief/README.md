# Addressing Online Misinformation: Vaccines and Autism

## Objective
The objective of this project is to understand how Reddit functions as a digital public sphere in relation to vaccine misinformation, specifically the false link between vaccines and autism. We aim to investigate how misinformation spreads on the platform and its potential impact on public health. By doing so, we hope to propose solutions for reducing the spread of misinformation and ensuring more informed public discourse.

## Data and Tools
For this project, we collected data through the Reddit API, using the query “vaccines autism” to retrieve the 100 most relevant posts and their comments. We applied text mining techniques to analyze the content and assess patterns of information dissemination. Tools such as Python (PRAW library) were used for data extraction, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques were employed to perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

## Key Question
The key question driving this research is: How does Reddit as a digital platform contribute to the spread of misinformation about vaccines and autism, and what role do echo chambers (subreddits) play in amplifying this misinformation?

## Results
Our findings indicate that Reddit’s structure, particularly the existence of subreddits, often creates echo chambers where misinformation can thrive. In the case of vaccine misinformation, we observed that discussions were polarized, with anti-vaccine sentiment dominating certain subreddits. Links between subreddits can increase engagement and spread misinformation to wider communities. Posts promoting evidence-based information on vaccines tended to receive less engagement compared to anti-vaccine content, highlighting the challenge of combating misinformation on this platform.

## Conclusion
Reddit, like many digital platforms, plays a significant role in shaping public perceptions of critical topics like vaccines and autism. The platform's design, which encourages user engagement within specific subreddits, can facilitate the spread of misinformation if not properly managed. To promote truthfulness and protect public health, it is essential for Reddit to implement stricter moderation policies and support fact-checking initiatives. This will foster a healthier digital public sphere where users can access accurate information and make informed decisions, particularly regarding sensitive topics like vaccination.
